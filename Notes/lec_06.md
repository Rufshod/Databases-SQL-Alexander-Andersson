  #databases
	- what does KiB mean, and what is it #card
		- kibibytes
		- 1024 bytes
	- what does MiB mean, and what is it #card
		- mibibytes
		- 1024 * 1024 bytes
	- what does KB mean, and what is it #card
		- kilobyte
		- 1000 bytes
	- what does MB mean, and what is it #card
		- 1000 * 1000 bytes
	- what does the newid() function do #card
		- gives each row a GUID
	- how to make a random sort on results #card
		- using newid()
		- ```SQL
		  ORDER BY newid()
		  ```
	- what are the pros and cons of using a subquery under select #card
		- possible to use other data under from since subquery is directly under select
		- subquery results only in one column, cannot be used in other columns unless repeating subquery multiple times
	- what are the pros and cons of using a subquery under from #card
		- possible to use subquery results in multiple columns
		- only data from subquery result can be used since only that data was selected
	- what is a potential efficiency loss of using subqueries under select instead of joins #card
		- if using a subquery that uses data from the main query, data will be accessed per row which is very inefficient
		- using join instead will only access and join data once, and then take out values from that joined result
	- what is SQLAlchemy #card
		- a tool to use SQL through Python
		- manages connectivity to database
		- interactions with database queries and results
		- programmatic construction of SQL statements

		- a string that says how to connect to a server
	- how to find connection strings #card
		- connectionstrings.com
	- what does the GO command do #card
		- GO is not an SQL command, it is an SSMS command
		- separates the code to finish running everything before and then runs the code after
		- can use like GO 3 to run the code before 3 times
