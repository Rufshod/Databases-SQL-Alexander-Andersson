    "1.1 Database\n",
    "- A database is a structured set of data stored and managed electronically. It allows you to store, organize, and retrieve information efficiently.\n",
    "- Examples of database management systems include SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Table\n",
    "- A table is a collection of related data organized into rows and columns within a database.\n",
    "- For example, you may have an Employees table that contains columns such as employee_id, first_name, last_name, and salary.\n",
    "- Each row in the table represents a single record, like an individual employee's details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 SQL\n",
    "- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language specifically designed for managing and interacting with databases.\n",
    "- It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data in tables, as well as manage the database structure itself.\n",

    "2.1 SELECT Statement\n",
    "- The SELECT statement is used to fetch and display data from a table in a database.\n",
    "- You can specify the columns you want to display and apply conditions to filter the data.\n",
    "- Example: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 INSERT Statement\n",
    "- The INSERT statement is used to add new data to a table.\n",
    "- You need to specify the table, the columns you want to insert data into, and the values you want to insert.\n",
    "- Example: INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 6000);\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 UPDATE Statement\n",
    "- The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.\n",
    "- You need to specify the table, the columns you want to update, and the new values, along with a condition to identify which rows to update.\n",
    "- Example: UPDATE employees SET salary = 7000 WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 DELETE Statement\n",
    "- The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table.\n",
    "- You need to specify the table and a condition to identify which rows to delete.\n",
    "- Example: DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",

    "### Chapter 3: Advanced SQL Queries and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Aggregate Functions\n",
    "- Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows in a table and return a single value.\n",
    "- Examples of aggregate functions include COUNT() for counting rows, SUM() for adding up values, AVG() for calculating the average of values, MIN() for finding the minimum value, and MAX() for finding the maximum value.\n",
    "- Example: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 JOINs\n",
    "- JOINs allow you to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column, creating a new set of data that includes information from both tables.\n",
    "- Types of JOINs include INNER JOIN (returns only rows with matching data in both tables), LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, filling in NULL values for non-matching rows), and RIGHT JOIN (returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table, filling in NULL values for non-matching rows).\n",
    "- Example: SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.name FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Subqueries and Views\n",
    "- A subquery is a query embedded within another query, allowing you to use the results of one query as input for another query.\n",
    "  - Example: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
    "- A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. It can simplify complex queries and provide a consistent way to access data.\n",
    "  - Example: CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;\n",

    "\n",
    "4.1 Database Design\n",
    "- Database design is the process of organizing data in a structured and efficient manner.\n",
    "- It involves creating tables, defining relationships between tables, and setting rules and constraints to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Table Relationships\n",
    "- Table relationships define how data is connected between tables.\n",
    "- Types of relationships include One-to-One (each row in one table is related to only one row in another table), One-to-Many (each row in one table is related to multiple rows in another table), and Many-to-Many (each row in one table is related to multiple rows in another table, and vice versa).\n",
    "- Example: An employee can belong to only one department (One-to-Many), and a department can have multiple employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Foreign Keys\n",
    "- A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "- This creates a link between the two tables and ensures that the data in the linked columns remains consistent.\n",
    "- Example: In the Employees table, the department_id column might be a foreign key that references the id column in the Departments table.\n",

    "\n",
    "5.1 Database Integrity\n",
    "- Database integrity refers to ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and follows defined rules and constraints.\n",
    "- Examples of integrity constraints include primary keys (unique identifiers for each row in a table), unique constraints (ensuring that a column contains unique values), and check constraints (ensuring that a column's value meets specific conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Normalization\n",
    "- Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce redundancy and improve performance.\n",
    "- The goal is to minimize data duplication and ensure that data is stored in the most efficient and logical way possible.\n",
    "- Common normal forms include First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3 ER Diagrams\n",
    "- Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams are a visual representation of a database's structure.\n",
    "- They show entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships between tables, helping to illustrate how data is organized and connected.\n",
    "- ER diagrams can be used to plan a database design or document an existing one.\n",

    "6.1 Python Database Connection\n",
    "- To connect to a database from Python, you can use libraries like pyodbc, pymssql, or SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "- These libraries help you establish a connection to a SQL Server database and interact with it using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2 SQLAlchemy\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides a higher-level, more convenient way of working with databases.\n",
    "- It allows you to interact with databases using Python objects and methods, instead of writing SQL queries directly.\n",
    "- Example: Using SQLAlchemy's ORM, you can create a Python class to represent a table, and then perform database operations using instances of that class.\n",

    "\n",
    "7.1 SQL Injection\n",
    "- SQL Injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into user input fields, potentially allowing them to view, modify, or delete data in the database.\n",
    "- To prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries, which separate SQL code from user input.\n",
    "- Example: Instead of concatenating user input directly into a SQL query, use placeholders and pass the user input as separate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.2 ACID Properties\n",
    "- ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure database transactions are reliable and consistent.\n",
    "- They include Atomicity (all parts of a transaction must succeed or the entire transaction fails), Consistency (the database is always in a consistent state before and after a transaction), Isolation (transactions are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts), and Durability (once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent).\n",
    "- Most relational database systems are designed to adhere to the ACID properties, ensuring the reliability of data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.3 Indexing\n",
    "- Indexing is the process of creating database indexes to speed up data retrieval.\n",
    "- An index is a data structure that allows the database to locate rows in a table more quickly, based on the values in one or more columns.\n",
    "- Example: Creating an index on the last_name column in the Employees table can make it faster to search for employees by their last name.\n",

    "\n",
    "8.1 Backup and Restore\n",
    "- Backup refers to creating a copy of your database, which can be used to recover the original data if needed. This is important for protecting your data against loss or corruption.\n",
    "- Restore is the process of applying a backup to recover lost or corrupted data. It involves replacing the current database with the data from the backup.\n",
    "- Example: Regularly backing up your database can help you minimize downtime and data loss in case of hardware failure or other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.2 NoSQL Databases\n",
    "- NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are an alternative to traditional relational databases that can be more suitable for certain use cases, such as handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "- They often use different data models and storage techniques, such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph databases.\n",
    "- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "- While this cheat sheet focuses on SQL and relational databases, it's essential to be aware of NoSQL options as well, as they can be a more appropriate choice for specific scenarios.Chapter 9: MongoDB and Atlas\n",
    "\n",
    "9.1 MongoDB\n",
    "- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.\n",
    "- Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for more natural representation of complex data structures.\n",
    "- MongoDB provides CRUD operations similar to SQL databases but uses a different syntax and query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.2 MongoShell and Community Server\n",
    "- MongoShell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB, which allows you to perform administrative tasks and run queries.\n",
    "- MongoDB Community Server is the open-source edition of MongoDB, which you can install and run on your local machine for development purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.3 Atlas (Cloud Service)\n",
    "- MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed, cloud-based database service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling MongoDB databases.\n",
    "- It provides features such as automated backups, monitoring, scaling, and security configurations.\n",
    "- Using Atlas can save time and effort when setting up and managing MongoDB databases compared to self-hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.4 Aggregation Pipeline\n",
    "- The aggregation pipeline is a MongoDB feature that allows you to perform complex data processing and transformation tasks by chaining together multiple stages.\n",
    "- Each stage in the pipeline processes the data and passes the result to the next stage, allowing you to filter, sort, group, and reshape the data as needed.\n",
    "- Example: An aggregation pipeline might start by filtering documents based on a condition, then group them by a specific field, and finally calculate the average value of a field for each group.\n"
