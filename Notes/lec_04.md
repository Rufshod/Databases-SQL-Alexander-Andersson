	- what are limitations of foreign keys #card
		- cannot enter a key that does not exist in the table where they are primary keys
		- this is generally a good limitation to ensure an invalid primary key is not entered
	- what are some different things that can be used as primary keys #card
		- ID - counting up from a start value (usually 1), incrementing by some value (usually 1)
		- unique ID for that type of object:
			- personnr - unique identifier for people
			- ISBM - unique identifier for books
		- GUID - 32 hexadecimal number identifier
	- TODO what is GUID
	- what types of joins are there #card
		- cross join
		- inner join
		- full join
		- left join
		- right join
	- what is cross join #card
		- join all possible combinations of rows from table A and B
		- resulting rows is always # of rows in table A times # of rows in table B
			- i.e. 3x1 join 3x1 table -> 9x1 table
	- what is inner join #card
		- join only matching in both tables
	- what is full join #card
		- join everything in both tables, even if not matching
	- what is left join #card
		- join on everything in left table, even if not matching with right
		- does not join on rows in right table that do not match with left
	- what is right join #card
		- join on everything in right table, even if not matching with left
		- does not join on rows in left table that do not match with right
	- what is the default type of join #card
		- inner join
		- if join is used without specifying the type, an inner join will be performed
	- how to declare an alias for a table #card
		- convention is for alias to be first letter(s) of table name
		- ```SQL
		  [Books] b
		  ```
	- what is one to many relation #card
		- a relation where:
			- rows of table A can be linked to multiple rows in table B
			- rows of table B can only be linked to one row in table A
		- example:
			- countries and cities:
				- countries can have many cities
				- cities can (usually) only be located in one country
	- what is many to many relation #card
		- a relation where:
			- rows of table A can be linked to multiple rows in table B
			- rows of table B can be linked to multiple rows in table A
		- example:
			- students and classes:
				- students can have many classes
				- classes can have many students
	- what is junction table #card
		- a table with 2 columns containing the IDs of 2 tables to join in a many to many relation
	- what is the conventional way of naming junction tables #card
		- tableaTableb
		- for example:
