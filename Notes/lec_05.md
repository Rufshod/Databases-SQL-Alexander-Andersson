		- decimal has fixed point precision while float has floating point precision
		- decimal can be specified to have a specific number of digits, both to the left and right of the decimal point
		- decimal is typically faster but loses the dynamic nature of a float
	- when writing a date like 'yyyy-mm-dd' what is the time #card

		- ```SQL
		  SET NOCOUNT ON;
		  ```
	- when to print instead of select #card

	- what are some configuration variables #card
		- TODO finish card info
		- nocount
		- statistics -
		- showplan - does not execute but instead shows analysis of how
		- ```SQL
